This repository contains codes for trying out video compression with generative model. 

Tons of codes are borrowed from https://github.com/cyrilli/Generative-Model-for-Video-Compression 

Todo List:
- [x] Training DCGAN on CelebA
- [x] Training a Vanilla Autoencoder to reconstruct images
- [ ] Using linear interpolation on latent variable to get missing frames
- [ ] Using LSTM on latent variables to predict the missing frames
